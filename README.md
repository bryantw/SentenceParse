# SentenceParse
Parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer.

# Examples:

1) “Smooth” becomes “S3h”
2) “Space separated” becomes “S3e s5d”
3) “Dash-separated” becomes “D2h-s5d”
4) “Number2separated” becomes “N4r2s5d”
